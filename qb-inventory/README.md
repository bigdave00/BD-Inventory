## Set up the decay system

If you want the decay system to work, then please read the information below, otherwise it won't work.

You need to add a decay value for all items in your `qb-core/shared/items.lua` file, the variable stands for the number of days it takes to decay.

### Examples:

#### Example of what you have to add

```lua
-- decay = The number of days it takes for an item to decay
-- delete = If set to true, the item will be removed once it decays
["decay"] = 28.0, ["delete"] = true
```

#### Example with the full item in QB-Core's shared file

```lua
['sandwich'] = {['name'] = 'sandwich', ['label'] = 'Sandwich', ['weight'] = 200, ['type'] = 'item', ['image'] = 'sandwich.png', ['unique'] = false, ['useable'] = true, ['shouldClose'] = true,	['combinable'] = nil, ['description'] = 'Nice bread for your stomach', ["decay"] = 3.0, ["delete"] = true},
```

In this example, the sandwich item would take 3 days to decay and once it does, it would be removed.
